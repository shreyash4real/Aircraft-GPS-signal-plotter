# Aircraft-GPS-signal-plotter
## The Bing-generated Python code for plotting static aircraft paths on google maps webpage. 


You should keep the following points in mind while executing and testing this on your own pc:
1) You necessarily need to create a folder and put the 'aircraftsignal.csv' file inside it alnogside the code file('drawtime.py' named as in my case).
2) The obtained result is stored in the 'plotted_data.html' file, while the code to create a webpage is super-duper-whooper lengthy, with the appropriate libraries you can do this in a line as everything else is done internallly in the backend.
3) To experience how the .html file is created by just debugging and running this code in your pc, one should exclude the 'plotted_data.html' file from the folder before running the code as a replica(such as plotted_data(1).html) is avoided and because of the presence of the result file no such new file will be created.
